# Doxyfile configuration for Doxygen

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories with
# spaces.
INPUT                  = README.md utility

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the FILE_PATTERNS
# tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp and *.h) to filter out the
# source-files in the directories. If left blank, Doxygen will consider all files.
FILE_PATTERNS          = *.cpp *.h

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should be
# searched for input files as well.
RECURSIVE              = YES

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path into
# which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is entered,
# it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started.
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = docs
